  EndingDialogue: "Giant: I think Ondra has gone towards the mountain.\r\nGnome:
    The mountain huh\u2026\r\nNarrator: The gnome thinks of the very tall, potentially
    very cold mountain. A shudder of reluctance comes over him.\r\nGnome: I think
    this is where\u2026\r\nGiant: Please can you help me search! \r\nNarrator: The
    Giant looks down on the gnome with pleading eyes. These seem ineffective against
    the gnome.\r\nGiant: I could make us some delicious soup? \r\nNarrator: The gnome
    thinks back to his empty kitchen and missing sister. \r\nGnome: I guess I can
    help for a little bit, my sister may have headed that way too I suppose.\r\nGiant:
    Yay!\r\nGnome: But just for a little bit!\r"
