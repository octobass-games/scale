  EndingDialogue: "Gnome: Let's stop here for today. I\u2019m getting pretty hungry\r\nGiant:
    Well lucky for you I found a bunch of carrots today.\r\nGnome: Ah carrot soup
    is my sister's specialty.\r\nGiant: Oh a secret family recipe? Perhaps you can
    share it with me.\r\nGnome: Oh I never cooked anything, she always did that\u2026
    \r\nGiant: And you did the chores in exchange? \r\nGnome:... well no\u2026 she
    does that too\u2026\r\nGiant:... \r\nNarrator: An awkward silence fell on the
    camp. The gnome thought back to their home, and all the work they didn\u2019t
    do. \r\nGnome: Perhaps\u2026 I could do more to help out.\r\nGnome: Could you
    teach me how to chop these carrots.\r\nGiant: Oh it's simple you just do this!\r\nNarrator:
    The gnome and giant look triumphantly at their carrot soup. They both take a
    spoonful.\r\nGiant: Wow, that's yummy!\r\nGnome: Yes it turned out surprisingly
    good. Perhaps I\u2019m a natural!\r\nGiant: Ha ha!\r\n"
