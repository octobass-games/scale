  EndingDialogue: "Gnome: Here looks like a good place to set up camp.\r\nGiant:
    I found some great mushrooms today!\r\nNarrator: The gnome did not particularly
    like mushrooms.\r\nGnome: Oh\u2026 great.\r\nNarrator: The giant, already set
    on cooking, missed the dejection in the gnome's words. \r\nGiant: This will be
    the best mushroom stew you have ever had!\r\nNarrator: The gnome slumps down
    on a log and awaits the ill-favoured stew.\r\nGiant: Here you are!\r\nNarrator:
    The gnome takes a tentative spoonful of the stew.\r\nNarrator: He swallows it
    down and realises it's not as bad as he originally thought.\r\nGnome: So, how
    long have you had your cat?\r\nGiant: I found her all alone in the woods when
    she was just a kitten. \r\nGiant: She was so thin and tiny. I think someone must
    have left her there.\r\nGnome: Well I guess she's lucky you found her then!\r\nGiant:
    No. It was me who was lucky! She's the best cat!\r"
